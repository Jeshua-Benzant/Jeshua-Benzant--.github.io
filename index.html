        <p> This is the home page of my website. This is the base page and the start of my coding journey.
            Hopefully I can blow you away with my skills soon with time. I am pushing to learn more about coding
        and to achieve a computer science minor. This page until now (2/1/2021) has been written in HTML.
        I can't wait to see how javascript makes changes to this website</p>
